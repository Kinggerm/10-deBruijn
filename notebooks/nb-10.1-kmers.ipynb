    "**kmers** are substrings of length k of a larger string. The concept of kmers is used widely within computational genomics, both for mathematical reasons having to do with their application in *graph theory*, as well as for practical computational reasons having to do with the way they can be efficiently stored in memory and compared as a way of measuring similarity of genomic regions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **de Bruijn graph** is a mathematical construct used in genome assembly and other network based problems. It relies on the conjecture that a sequence can be reconstructed by substrings of that sequence if all substrings are present and overlap by n-1 (more on this later). An example type of substring is genomic short read sequences, which are a subset of the full genome sequence they are generated from. In practice, short reads may not overlap each other by n-1, but by using smaller kmers from each of many short reads more substrings can be generated which may more easily overlap by n-1 and thus be used to reconstruct the sequence. See image for example.\n",

We can see visually that any individual read does not contain enough information to construct the full contig, but that in combination the three reads could. The trick of **genome assembly** is figuring out the correct positioning and ordering of reads such that they will overlap correctly to represent the full genome sequence. Through the development of *graph theory* this problem can be re-stated by assigning the kmers in a string as nodes or edges in a graph and finding the shortest cycle/path that visits each node once (the Eulerian cycle).

When the data are represented in this way it is easier to find a unique path -- a unique way in which to order the kmers that will reconstruct the genome string. Below I wrote out the 10 kmers in this string that we extracted computationally using slicing above. "
